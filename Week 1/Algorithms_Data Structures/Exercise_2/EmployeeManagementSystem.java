/*
Employee Management System
Scenario: 
You are developing an employee management system for a company. Efficiently managing employee records is crucial.
Steps:
1.Understand Array Representation:
  Explain how arrays are represented in memory and their advantages.
2.Setup:
  Create a class Employee with attributes like employeeId, name, position, and salary.
3.Implementation:
  Use an array to store employee records.
  Implement methods to add, search, traverse, and delete employees in the array.
4.Analysis:
  Analyze the time complexity of each operation (add, search, traverse, delete).
  Discuss the limitations of arrays and when to use them.
